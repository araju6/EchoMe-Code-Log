  <h1>EchoMe Code Logs</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to EchoMe Code Logs! Our startup is dedicated to creating children's toys that promote proper speech development through auditory bombardment. We believe that early exposure to rich, diverse language experiences can significantly enhance a child's speech and language skills. Our toys are designed to engage children in fun and interactive ways while providing them with the auditory stimulation they need to develop clear and fluent speech.</p>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this repository is to document the codebase and development process behind our innovative toys. By maintaining detailed logs of our coding activities, we aim to facilitate collaboration among team members, track progress, and ensure transparency in our development efforts.</p>
